# Pain-Detection-From-Facial-Expressions

* The aim of this project is to build an automatic pain detection system based on facial expressions, which can be used in smart hospitals. 
* The [Dataset](https://sites.pitt.edu/~emotion/um-spread.htm) used in this project has been gathered by the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of North British Columbia and McMaster University, for research purposes only. 
* The data preprocessing was done using the OpenCV library and the pain detection model was built and trained using PyTorch.
* The main findings of this project have been published on an article on the Journal of Software Engineering and Applications (JSEA): [Karamitsos, I. , Seladji, I. and Modak, S. (2021) A Modified CNN Network for Automatic Pain Identification Using Facial Expressions.
